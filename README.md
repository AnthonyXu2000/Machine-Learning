# US Lung Cancer Machine Learning Project (Python):

This project is guided by professor Samin Aref. The objective is to predict the mortality rate of lung cancer in the United States.

**The main steps of the project:**

•	Improved data quality and identified feature relationships through data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

•	Developed an OLS regression model to predict lung cancer mortality rates, using diagnostic tools such as VIF to optimize the model.

•	Evaluated model performance on a test set to ensure accuracy and effectiveness of predicting outcomes.
